# Choreography Framework

## Description
Choreography-framework is a specialized tool designed to interlace seamlessly with Stable Diffusion's Deforum. It's a dual-purpose framework that not only streamlines the creation of animations but also provides an aesthetic framework to conceptualize Deforum videos. The framework features a "Sequence Builder" GPT and a webpage functioning as a video editor, focusing on facilitating natural language descriptions of envisioned movements and motions, allowing the rest to be managed computationally.

## Motivation
The inspiration behind Choreography-framework is the desire to simplify the process of video creation with Deforum, especially targeting animation and music video production. The goal is to shift the user's focus to creative conceptualization while the framework handles the technical execution.

## Key Features
- **Settings.txt File Creation:** Generates a comprehensive settings.txt file that can be directly imported into the Deforum web UI or Colab, containing all necessary project information.

## Installation and Usage
- **Webpage Usage:** Access the framework directly through the provided webpage for an easy-to-use, browser-based experience.
- **Local Installation:** Alternatively, for a more hands-on approach, download and run the application locally using Node.js, accessible via a web browser.
